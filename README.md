# DICAanlyzer
This MATLAB APP seamlessly fuses HRDIC and EBSD data. It provides an integrated suite for precise mapping, grain analysis, and visualization to directly correlate material microstructure with local mechanical behavior, simplifying complex post-processing tasks.

* Abstract
The DIC-EBSD Fusion Toolbox is a MATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI) platform designed to address the challenges of integrating and analyzing data from High-Resolution Digital Image Correlation (HRDIC) and Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD). It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for data fusion, post-processing, quantitative analysis, and visualization, enabling researchers in materials science and mechanics to efficiently correlate microstructural features with local mechanical responses.
